Fina all genes from one long strand of DNA:
All genes start from ATG codon and end with one codon among TAA, TGA, and TAG.
The length of each genes must be multiple of three.
The tasks are below:
  How many genes are in this file?        
  How many genes in this file are longer than 60?
  How many genes in this file have cgRatio greater than 0.35?
  How many times does the codon CTG appear in this strand of DNA?
  What is the length of the longest gene in the collection of genes found in this file?
